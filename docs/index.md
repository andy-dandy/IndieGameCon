# What is Indie Game Con?
1. A place where game developers can meet, make new connections and exchange ideas.
2. An event where game developers can show off their creator-owned games to the mainstream audience.

IGC has been an annual event in Eugene, Oregon since 2013.

### When and Where?
Indie Game Con will be happening Saturday-Sunday November 9th & 10th 2019.
Location is TBD but will definitely be downtown, Eugene.

## Submit a game
We are looking for games that can be shown at the event. Maybe you have a prototype project. We can help you with feedback. Perhaps you are ready to show off your creation. We can get you exposure. Or maybe you have a long lost project you just want to show the world. That works too! We would love to see all your creations and projects!
